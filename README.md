# Android Network Config Generator

Simple [Android Network Security](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-config) setup script.

## Motivation
Creating configurations should be simple, but it not always is. For those who found configuring certificate pinning in
Android apps complicated I created this simple script. It will guide you step-by-step through the configuration process
with series of questions generating the ready-to-paste configuration that you can just copy-paste into your project! 

## Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.12.+

- First clone the project and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run script `python config_generator.py`
- Follow the on-screen instructions.
